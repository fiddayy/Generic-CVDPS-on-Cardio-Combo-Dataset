# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction using Stacking-based ensemble classifier on a combined multiple heterogenous datasets

ðŸ”¬ **Datasets**: Cleveland (303 samples), Statlog (270 samples), Hungarian (294 samples), Switzerland (123 samples), and Long-Beach VA (200 samples) Datasets.

ðŸ§  **Model**: Novel two layered Stacking-Based Ensemble Classifier.

ðŸ“Š **Comparison**: Number of Machine Learning, Ensemble-Based, and Deep Learning Models

ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**: Predict risk of cardiovascular diseases in patients based on lifestyle factors and medical data using 55 different features like age, weight, body mass index, smoking, other diseases, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.

ðŸ“Š **Performance**:
- Accuracy: 99.16%, 96.64%, 95.52%, 96.01%, 95.29%
- Testing ratios: 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%
- Other evaluation matrics: Confusion matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
